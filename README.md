# Email Organizer
This is an ember app I built as part of the [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/) curriculum in downtown Portland. It was built using a bootstrap inspired css file called paper from bootswatch.  I also added my own css and adjusted the bootswatch file to suit my needs.  The rotating envelopes use some simple css3 animations that I found online.
